With the {% extends %} template tag we tell Django to inherit from the blog/base.html template.
truncatewords does what it says on the tin - i.e. truncates the number of words to the given number (30)
linebreaks converts the output into HTML line breaks.

You can concatenate as many template filters as you wish; each one will be applied to the output generated
by the preceding one.

Since the Page object we are passing to the template is called posts, we include the pagination template 
in the post list template, passing the parameters to render it correctly. You can follow this method to
reuse your pagination template in the paginated views of different models.
